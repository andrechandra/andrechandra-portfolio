          Realty, to help establish their digital presence and make it easier
          for clients to discover their services. The site includes several main
          pages—Home, Portfolio, Our Agents, Cari Titip, and Tools—each serving
          specific needs for property browsing and agent engagement.

          One of the core features is the “Our Agents” page, which dynamically

          as a lightweight CMS. This allows the agency to easily update agent
          information without needing to access the codebase. Built with
          Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI components, the site is designed
          for speed, clarity, and responsiveness across devices.

          This expense tracker represents one of my first ventures into
          full-stack web development, combining modern technologies like
          Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui for the frontend, with Prisma and
          PostgreSQL handling the backend database operations. The application
          features a clean, intuitive interface that allows users to easily
          track their financial transactions and manage their personal finances.

          Users can securely log in using Clerk authentication, add and
          categorize their income and expenses, and visualize their financial
          data through interactive charts and summaries. The application
          provides detailed transaction history, category-wise breakdowns, and
          financial trends over time. This project helped me gain hands-on
          experience with full-stack development, database management, and
          implementing secure user authentication in a real-world application.

          Math Fantasy is my final project at Universitas Multimedia Nusantara,
          where I developed a top-down 2D RPG-style game designed to make
          learning statistics more engaging. The game utilizes the Fisher-Yates
          algorithm to randomly shuffle questions, ensuring that players cannot
          memorize answers and are challenged with new question sets each time
          they play. In the game, players must defeat enemies before reaching a
          sign that contains a series of questions related to statistics. The
          core aim of the game is to enhance learning motivation by
          incorporating educational elements into an interactive, fun gameplay
          experience.
        </p>
        <p className="font-geist_mono tracking-tighter text-gray-400">
          The game was created using Unity Engine version 2021.3.16f1, and I
          used 2D assets obtained from itch.io to bring the game to life. The
          game&apos;s mechanics are focused on rewarding problem-solving and
          learning, offering a dynamic experience where players actively
          participate in their education while also enjoying an adventure. By
          blending education with gaming, Math Fantasy seeks to encourage
          students to stay motivated and improve their knowledge in a fun and
          immersive way.
